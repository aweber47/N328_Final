<h4>Documentation For the Visual</h4>
<p>
    I used a straightforward design process to create this dynamic radar chart. I think that as much info as possible
    should be available for the consumer to engage with. I initially had to make changes to the dataset's CSV file. The
    dataset's numeric values were configured as strings, so when d3 parsed them, they wouldn't actually appear unless I
    manually changed them to decimal numbers. After resolving that problem and further tidying it up, I was able to
    begin working on the visual. I wanted to address the question of how to enable user interaction with the visual as
    the initial part of the design. I decided the radar chart should appear
    to the user as a simplistic like a "hover" design to display the information.</p>

    I proceed to create two distinct radar plots. The global averages of the COVID data are the subject of one of these
    radar charts.
    The other radar chart focuses on the totals for each particular nation. The radar chart is interactive in a few
    different ways, one of which is that you can hover over the various sections to see the filter appear. I also
    provided the consumers the option to edit the data whatever they pleased. I accomplished this by hosting the data in
    a "textarea"
    so users don't have to be concerned about changing it. By
    letting a user add or use previously gathered data values and pressing a button, the radar chart displays those
    numbers. Making that image was absolutely awesome! I'm happy I was able to use them in my finished product! The
    radar chart's color scheme is pleasing to the eye and makes it easier to grasp the data values. In actual use, a
    user could add or delete nations to make the graphic even clearer or just to ensure that it only displays the
    nations they are concerned about. The total cases and total cases divided by population are just two of the many
    variables that make up the radar chart (so it is detailed). Overall, the radar chart appeals to the eye,
    is distinctive when it comes to displaying COVID data, and is a novel visual that I hope the user will like
    interacting with.

    In the end, I really enjoyed this final project because it taught me how to use JavaScript and d3 to create amazing
    data visualizations. I've always created my graphics using Tableau or machine learning algorithms, but knowing d3
    has truly changed the way I consider what tools to use to show my data. I'm glad I gave this course serious
    consideration and incorporated it into my academic studies!
